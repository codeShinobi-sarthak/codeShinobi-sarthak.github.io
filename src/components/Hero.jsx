                        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Sarthak Jain, a passionate developer
                        focused on crafting innovative and efficient solutions
                        through code. From building engaging web applications to
                        exploring the intricacies of data structures and
                        algorithms, I thrive on solving complex problems. My
                        current focus is on full-stack development, where Iâ€™m
                        creating dynamic projects using technologies like React,
                        Node.js, and Three.js. <br />
                        Iâ€™m always excited to learn and grow, whether itâ€™s
                        mastering new programming concepts or tackling
                        real-world challenges. Right now, Iâ€™m diving into graph
                        theory and working on immersive projects like a solar
                        system simulation. Letâ€™s connect and build something
                        awesome together!
